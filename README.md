SplitMate is a collaborative expense-sharing app built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack, designed to help friends, roommates, and groups easily track and settle shared expenses. With a clean and intuitive interface, users can create groups, add expenses, and manage balances, making it easier to keep track of who owes what.
